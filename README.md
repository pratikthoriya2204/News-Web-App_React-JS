<h1>News Web App Using React JS</h1>
<h4>Here I have created a NEWS Webapp using React.js.
In this app, I used the Fetch function to call API from the URL.
This is my first API web app using the React.js Library of javascript.
In this app, I have given multiple categories of news like:- Business, Sports, Entertainment, Health, Technology & much more.</h4>
